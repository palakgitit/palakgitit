# ⭐ Featured Projects

## 🕉 Bhagavad Gita Web App

A structured and interactive web application that displays Bhagavad Gita verses in a clean and readable format.

### 🔍 Why This Project Stands Out
- Built using **JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap**
- **Responsive layout** for all screen sizes
- Fetches data from an **API** dynamically
- Saves user preferences with **localStorage**
- Organized data handling and clean UI design
- Structured and maintainable codebase

This project demonstrates my ability to build real-world applications with interactive features, responsive design, and basic front-end data persistence.
